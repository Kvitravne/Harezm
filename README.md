Data Sharing Commitment

Within the scope of our project, all collected data is obtained in real-time solely through sensors mounted on the vehicle. These data are utilized for purposes such as object recognition, lane tracking, environmental mapping, location tracking, voice command detection, and system error analysis.

Types of Data and Usage

Image Data: Acquired from the vehicle-mounted camera in JPEG/MP4 format, used for object detection and lane tracking.

LIDAR Data: Point cloud data obtained from the LIDAR sensor, processed for distance measurement and mapping purposes.

GPS Data: Collected from the GPS module in JSON format, evaluated for location tracking.

Audio Data: Captured from the audio sensor board in MP3/WAV format, used for voice command recognition.

System Logs: Log files stored locally on the onboard computer, utilized for debugging and test analysis.

Data Storage and Security

Collected data is initially stored temporarily on the onboard computer for short-term use. Important and necessary data are transferred to a central computer for long-term storage. All data is accessible only to the project team and protected with security measures. Weekly backups are securely performed on external SSD drives.

Data Sharing and Privacy

The data collected in the project does not contain personal information and is used exclusively for internal testing, analysis, and model training purposes. These data will not be shared with external third parties nor used for any other purposes.

Ethical and Legal Compliance

Data collection, processing, and storage activities are conducted in full compliance with applicable data protection regulations and ethical standards. Throughout the project, no personal data will be collected; only environmental and system data will be managed transparently and responsibly.
